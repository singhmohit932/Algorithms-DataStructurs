//Bellman-Ford algorithm allows you to check whether there exists a cycle of negative weight in the graph, 
//and if it does, find one of these cycles.

//The details of the algorithm are described in the article on the Bellman-Ford algorithm. Here we'll describe
//only its application to this problem.

//Do N iterations of Bellman-Ford algorithm. If there were no changes on the last iteration, there is no cycle of negative weight in the graph. Otherwise take a vertex the distance to which has changed, and go from it via its ancestors until a cycle is found.
//This cycle will be the desired cycle of negative weight.
